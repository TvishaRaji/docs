# Getting Started with RabbitHoles

## Your First Node  
Get your first AI-powered node up and running in RabbitHoles.

## Features Overview  

- **Create your Canvas** â€“ Start with a blank workspace where you can structure your flow.  
- **Connect Nodes** â€“ Link Text Nodes, YouTube URLs, and Image Nodes to add context to your Chat Nodes.  
- **Choose Your Model** â€“ Select from different AI models using your configured API key.  
- **Run AI Tasks** â€“ Execute your nodes to generate insights.  
- **Build Complex Workflows** â€“ Experiment with various node types to create a rich, interconnected environment.  

## Sign Up and Sign In  

- Locate and click on Download for Mac OS (Silicon) or Download for Mac OS (Intel) whichever is compatible with your computer from [Rabbitholes](https://rabbitholes.ai)

## Create Your First Canvas  

Weâ€™re going to build a **Canvas** that helps generate and refine ideas. This will give you a feel for how RabbitHoles works and how best to structure your workflows.  

After logging in, youâ€™ll land on the **dashboard**, where you can create a new **Canvas**. Click **"New Canvas"**, and youâ€™ll be met with a **blank workspace**, ready for you to start building your first AI-powered research flow.

One of RabbitHoles' strengths is breaking down into **structured, connected insights**. Letâ€™s start by adding a **node** that outlines key topics.  

### Instruction for the first AI node:  

> *"I want to explore the latest trends in AI-driven healthcare. Generate an outline with five key topics to cover."*  

After entering this instruction, a **Chat Node** will be created, ready to generate insights.  


## Run Your First Node  

By default, nodes execute when you click the **"Ask"** button at the bottom right of the node.  

RabbitHoles allows you to select different **AI models** configured with your API key. Before running the node, ensure youâ€™ve selected the appropriate **model in the settings**.  
To setup your API key, refer to [API Key Setup](/api/anthropic.mdx)

Once executed, youâ€™ll see the AI begin **generating the outline**, streaming the results directly into the node.  


## Review Your First Output  

Once the AI has completed processing your instruction, the **output** will be displayed in the node.  

You can review the output easily by switching to **Reader Mode** by clicking the **expand icon** at the top right of the node. This provides a **clean, distraction-free** view of your AI-generated insights.  


## Why Connecting Nodes Solves Context Limitations
One of the core technical advantages of connecting nodes in RabbitHoles is that it helps overcome AI context limitations and prevents loss of previous insights. Here's how:

### ðŸ”— Maintaining Context Across Conversations
AI models often have a limited context window, meaning they can only process a certain number of tokens at a time. When queries exceed this limit, earlier context gets truncated, leading to incomplete responses.

By connecting nodes:
- You create a linked chain of insights, ensuring that previous discussions remain accessible.
- Each node acts as a memory block, preserving details that would otherwise be lost.

### âš¡ Seamless AI Query Execution
Rather than relying on one-off queries that quickly forget earlier parts of a conversation, RabbitHoles lets you connect and reference past nodes. This allows for:
- Better accuracy in AI responses by feeding previous context naturally.
- Long-form capabilities, helping you explore deep topics without losing track of key points.


Now that youâ€™ve created and run your first node, you can start **building more complex flows** by adding and connecting multiple nodes.  

Experiment with different node types like **Image, YouTube, and Text Nodes** to create your own **Rabbithole**! ðŸš€
