# Getting Started with RabbitHoles

## Your First Node  
Get your first AI-powered node up and running in RabbitHoles.

## Features Overview  

- **Create your Canvas** â€“ Start with a blank workspace where you can structure your research flow.  
- **Connect Nodes** â€“ Link Text Nodes, YouTube URLs, and Image Nodes to add context to your Chat Nodes.  
- **Choose Your Model** â€“ Select from different AI models using your configured API key.  
- **Run AI Tasks** â€“ Execute your nodes to generate insights.  
- **Build Complex Workflows** â€“ Experiment with various node types to create a rich, interconnected research environment.  



## Sign Up and Sign In  

- Locate and click on Download for Mac OS (Silicon) or Download for Mac OS (Intel) whichever is compatible with your computer from [Rabbitholes](https://rabbitholes.ai)


## Create Your First Canvas  

Weâ€™re going to build a **Canvas** that helps generate and refine ideas for a research project. This will give you a feel for how RabbitHoles works and how best to structure your workflows.  

After logging in, youâ€™ll land on the **dashboard**, where you can create a new **Canvas**. Click **"New Canvas"**, and youâ€™ll be met with a **blank workspace**, ready for you to start building your first AI-powered research flow.

One of RabbitHoles' strengths is breaking down research into **structured, connected insights**. Letâ€™s start by adding a **node** that outlines key topics for a research paper.  

### Instruction for the first AI node:  

> *"I want to explore the latest trends in AI-driven healthcare. Generate an outline with five key topics to cover in a research paper."*  

After entering this instruction, a **Chat Node** will be created, ready to generate insights.  


## Run Your First Node  

By default, nodes execute when you click the **"Ask"** button at the bottom right of the node.  

RabbitHoles allows you to select different **AI models** configured with your API key. Before running the node, ensure youâ€™ve selected the appropriate **model in the settings**.  
To setup your API key, refer to [API Key Setup](/api/anthropic.mdx)

Once executed, youâ€™ll see the AI begin **generating the research outline**, streaming the results directly into the node.  



## Review Your First Output  

Once the AI has completed processing your instruction, the **output** will be displayed in the node.  

You can review the output easily by switching to **Reader Mode** by clicking the **expand icon** at the top right of the node. This provides a **clean, distraction-free** view of your AI-generated insights.  



Now that youâ€™ve created and run your first node, you can start **building more complex research flows** by adding and connecting multiple nodes.  

Experiment with different node types like **Image, YouTube, and Text Nodes** to create a **rich research environment**! ðŸš€
