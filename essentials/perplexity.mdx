- After logging in to [RabbitHoles.AI](http://RabbitHoles.AI) with your secure key, you’ll see an option for API keys on the dashboard.
- Click on the option “Get your API keys here” to access the [Perplexity API Keys](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api).

## Step 2: Sign Up or Log In

To access the Perplexity API, you need an account. If you don’t already have one:

- Visit the [Perplexity AI website](https://www.perplexity.ai).
- Click **Sign Up** and enter your details.
- Verify your email and log in.

If you already have an account, simply **Log In** to proceed.

## Step 3: Visit the API Settings Page

Once logged in, navigate to the **Perplexity API Settings** page to manage your API credentials.

## Step 4: Register Your Credit Card

Before generating an API key, you must add a valid payment method:

- Navigate to the **Billing** section.
- Add a credit or debit card.

> No charges will be made at this step, but your card is stored for future API usage.

Do add in a minimum amount of 5$ for the API key

## Step 5: Generate an API Key

Once your payment details are verified:

1. Go to the **API Keys** section.
2. Click **Generate New Key**.
3. Copy and **securely store** your API key, as it won’t be displayed again.

## Important Notes:
- The API key is a **long-lived access token**.
- It remains valid until **manually refreshed or deleted**.
