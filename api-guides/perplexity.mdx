> No charges will be made at this step, but your card is stored for future API usage.

Do add in a minimum amount of 5$ for the API key

## Step 5: Generate an API Key

Once your payment details are verified:

1. Go to the **API Keys** section.
2. Click **Generate New Key**.
3. Copy and **securely store** your API key, as it won’t be displayed again.

## Important Notes:
- The API key is a **long-lived access token**.
- It remains valid until **manually refreshed or deleted**.
